### Database Schema

The application uses SQLite3 for data persistence. The following tables are defined:

**user_preferences:** Stores user preferences like age range, gender preference, etc.
**user_activities:** Tracks liked, disliked, and matched users.

### Compatibility Scoring

The app calculates compatibility scores based on:

**Bio-Bio Matching**: Compare user bios to find common keywords.
**Interests-Interests Matching**: Compare user interests.
**Bio-Interests Matching**: Compare bio keywords with the other user's interests and vice versa.
**Location Matching**: Scores based on proximity.
**Age Difference**: Scores based on age differences.

These scores are used to recommend the most compatible matches to users.
